	        <p>The Church of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan group is located in Horn Lake,  MS. It's a Ku Klux Klan group. The Klan is America&#39;s oldest and most notorious racist organisation. Founded in 1865 after the slave-owning Confederate states lost in the US Civil War, it was once a single organisation, with members across the US. Now it has splintered into rival groups. Though it has focussed its violence on African-Americans, Klan groups have also attacked Catholics and immigrants..
