    	<h1>ACT for America</h1>
    	<div class="text-container" style="width:750px;">
	        <p>The ACT for America group is located in Pierce County,  WA. It's a Anti-Muslim group. Anti-Muslim groups are a relatively new phenomenon in the radical right, emerging in in the US in the wake of 9/11. The movement is the fastest growing in the US, with the number of groups tripling in the last year. Followers make no distinctions between radical Islam and other branches of the faith, portray Muslims as engaged in a plot to take over the West, and call for them to be barred from public service..
