    	<h1>League of the South</h1>
    	<div class="text-container" style="width:750px;">
	        <p>The League of the South group is located in Aiken,  SC. It's a Neo Confederate group. Neo-Confederacy groups celebrate the slave-owning antebellum South, and call for its racist practices to be renewed. The Confederate flag has become a contentious symbol in the US, and is banned in public buildings in some states after mass killer Dylann Roof was pictured posing with it. Neo-Confederacy groups loudly champion its use..
